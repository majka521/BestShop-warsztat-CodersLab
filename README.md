# BestShop - workshop CodersLab

## Description

BestShop is a worhshop created for CodersLab JavaScript Developer bootcamp.

**BestShop** is a one-page website created during CodersLab workshop. It was created based on a project received in Adobe XD. It presents online store management services by a company invented for the workshop.
The website has been created fully responsive, so I recommend viewing it on different devices.
